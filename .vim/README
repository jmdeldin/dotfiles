The setup is fairly modular -- in $HOME/.vimrc, include the following:

    " load the base vimrc"
    so $HOME/.vim/vimrc

    " vars for the auth; mapping
    let full_name = 'Author Name'
    let email = 'email@example.com'

    " load the base gvimrc (this could also be done from ~/.gvimrc)
    if has('gui_running')
        so $HOME/.vim/gvimrc
    endif
